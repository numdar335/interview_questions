# interview_questions

Here are my answers to some [technical interview questions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coding_interview). I categorized them by company, which is a **very** impractical way to organize this repository, but the repository looks **a lot** cooler this way, haha.

Not all of my answers are boring! One example is [my answer](https://github.com/numdar335/interview_questions/blob/main/JPMorgan%20Chase/leetcode_0017.py) to the ["Letter Combinations of a Phone Number" question](https://leetcode.com/problems/letter-combinations-of-a-phone-number/), which  
<sub>(as of April 21, 2021)</sub> is faster <sub>(judging by program runtime, not necessarily by algorithmic efficiency)</sub> than 99.69% of all Python3 answers <sub>(to that question)</sub> that have ever been submitted to LeetCode! I have other examples too :D

Uhh I kinda have to point out that most of my code here is **far** from optimal in terms of formatting and tweaking, and I feel really insecure about it but then again I don't really want to fix it, it is **a lot** of code after all.
