# interview_questions

Here are my answers to some [technical interview questions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coding_interview). I categorized them by company, which is a **very** impractical way to organize this repository, but the repository looks **a lot** cooler this way, haha.

Most of my answers are boring, but there are some exceptions. One example is [my answer](https://github.com/numdar335/interview_questions/blob/main/Facebook/leetcode_0054.py) to the ["Spiral Matrix" question](https://leetcode.com/problems/spiral-matrix/), which <sub>(as of November 18, 2020)</sub> is faster <sub>(judging by program runtime, not necessarily by algorithmic efficiency)</sub> than 98.41% of all Python3 answers <sub>(to that question)</sub> that have ever been submitted to LeetCode!  There are other examples too :D
